       <p>Can we just sit down, have a little conversation?
        Yeah,  <span style="background-color: #FFA500"> I want to talk it out 'cause I'm all up in my feelings
        I never felt this before
        And I just wanna feel some more
        We used to keep it casual
        Now I wanna just be yours </span>
        Can we sit down, try to have a little conversation?</li>

        <p>See you got me all in my head
          Every day with you is like the weekend
          <span style="background-color: #FFA500">   I tried to quit but truth is I don't want to
          'Cause 24/7 I'm thinking about you </span>
          24/7 I'm thinking about
          You, you, you, you, you, you, you
          You, you, you, you
          24/7 I'm thinking about
          You, you, you, you, you, you, you
          You, you, you, you
          24/7 I'm thinking about you

                          I know you just left but I'm missing you like crazy</span>
                          I usually don't get this far
                          I always cut 'em off before
                          My heart gets in too deep
                          I might let you in too deep
                          Now tell me, how's that for a little motivation?
